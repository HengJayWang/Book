Bluetooth Low Energy with Android and Arduino
========================================================


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with Android and Arduino_ (<url>).  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices talk using Arduino in Java and Android in C++.

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the book, please consider doing so.
